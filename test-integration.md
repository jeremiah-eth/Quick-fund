# Base Account SDK Integration Test

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **Base Account SDK Setup**
- Created `lib/baseAccountSDK.ts` with proper SDK configuration
- Configured Sub Accounts with `creation: 'on-connect'` and `defaultAccount: 'sub'`
- Set up proper app name and logo URL

✅ **Custom Hook Integration**
- Created `hooks/useBaseAccount.ts` for managing wallet state
- Integrated with Base Account SDK provider
- Added Base Name resolution for both Universal and Sub Accounts
- Implemented transaction sending with `wallet_sendCalls`

✅ **Updated Components**
- Modified `WalletConnection.tsx` to use the new Base Account integration
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to use the new hook instead of mock data
- Removed old mock wallet connection logic

✅ **Key Features**
- Automatic Sub Account creation on wallet connection
- Real Base Name resolution using viem
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Transaction sending capability with Sub Accounts

## How to Test

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Wallet Connection**
   - Click "Connect Base Account"
   - Should automatically create a Sub Account
   - Both Universal and Sub Account addresses should be displayed
   - Base Names should be resolved and shown

4. **Test Expense Creation**
   - Create a new expense with participants
   - Test Base Name input validation
   - Test Auto Spend Permissions flow

## Expected Behavior

- **Wallet Connection**: Uses real Base Account SDK with automatic Sub Account creation
- **Base Names**: Real resolution using viem and Base Name service
- **Transactions**: Uses `wallet_sendCalls` for better UX with Sub Accounts
- **Auto Spend Permissions**: Integrated with Base Account SDK's permission system

## Next Steps

1. Test the integration in browser
2. Verify Base Name resolution works
3. Test transaction sending
4. Add paymaster configuration for gas sponsorship
5. Implement real payment flows
